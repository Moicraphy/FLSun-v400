V1.0 There are three nozzle sizes (0.25, 0.4, and 0.8) to select from as well as under the 0.4 nozzle selection you have sub catagories of "default" "engineering" "visual" and "draft".

I also reworked the definition file for the V400 in order to remove the annoying yellow "warning" that occurs when you set print speed to 400
